POOF
====

POOF is a Programmatic, Object Oriented, and Orthogonal Framework for PHP, using a non-conventional approach to Web development.

The purpose of this framework is to hide all aspects of HTML, AJAX, and CSS inside high level generic objects, providing for rapid development and easy modifications without the conventional multi-file MVC approach.

Design Concepts
---------------

* Top level code is extremely easy to read, compact, and correlates directly to result
* Object chains similar to EDEN allow flexibility and extensibility

Getting Started
---------------

View [demo.php](https://github.com/stgnet/poof/blob/master/demo.php) for an example.  To create your own
project, clone poof into your project directory, copy poof/demo.php to index.php and modify to build
your own website.

Included Components
-------------------

POOF includes and uses these existing projects:

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com) for AJAX
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) for CSS/HTML5
